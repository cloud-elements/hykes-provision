## Branching Model

This project works off of a continuous release approach and uses the
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching workflow model.

## Versioning Model

While this project works off a continuous release approach,
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) is used as a decorator to break up new features, bug
fixes, and documentation into digestible chunks for third-parties.
